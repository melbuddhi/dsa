# DSA in Python

This folder contains problems I have solved while learning DSA.

* Clone this on PyCharm using these steps:

    [Click here](https://youtu.be/egpbzk5u0xA?si=Rk7PtGqCVei7epT7) to see how to do this.

    1. Create project using VSC
    2. For URL paste this link 'https://github.com/melbuddhi/dsa.git'
    3. Click Clone
    4. Run a file to test if the program is running.

Even after following these steps if it does not work, make sure that the interpreter is configured. You might see a yellow message at the top of your .py file to fix such issues.

Some notes:

* For recent files, I have added [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) package to calculate the execution time.
* Currently, problems are not categorised but will be moved later on into separate folders.
* Programs which are tough to understand can be searched with the name of the .py file on [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
